# Crystals Collector Game

## How to Play
When the game begins, a random number is generated as the target number. The object of the game is to click on the crystals to get your sum equal to the target number. If the players score goes over the target number, it counts as a loss and a new random number is generated. Each time the game begins, the crystals get a new value assigned to them.
